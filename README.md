 ### Project description:
You are in a chaotic children's room. In the shape of a toddler, you can move around in your room and take some toys. Your mom screams at you which toy to put into the Toy Box. Your task is to find this toy, take it and put it into the box.
Once you've done your job properly, the globe will start spinning and you'll get candys!

 ### Controls:
 To get around you have to look at one of the sweets distributed on the floor. As soon as you hit one with the white dot, you move.
